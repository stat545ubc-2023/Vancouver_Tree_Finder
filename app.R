#Feature: Added parameter to plot to allow user to change colour of bars, this can help visualize bars better and makes it more appealing
#Feature: Put plot and table in separate tabs, this makes the app more organized and visually appealing
#Feature: Multiple select for curb, this allows more variation and analysis of data as it offers more options for selection easily

#Feature : Used DT package to create an interactive table, this helps user select specific variables they want to see faster.
